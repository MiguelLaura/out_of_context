# Out-of-context

A discord bot to store and call quotes from a guild.

## To launch it

This bot must have access to message content.

Inside this directory, create a .env file containing:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-bot-token
DISCORD_GUILD=your-guild-name
```

You also must create a out_of_context.txt file (it can be empty).

To run the code:
```bash
python bot.py
```

When successfully launched, it should return:
```
out-of-context has connected to Discord!
guild_name(id: guild_id)
```

## What does it do?

It can react to things happening on the guild, and has specific commands.
